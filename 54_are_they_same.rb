Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities. "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order.

Examples
Valid arrays
a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]  
b = [121, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
comp(a, b) returns true because in b 121 is the square of 11, 14641 is the square of 121, 20736 the square of 144, 361 the square of 19, 25921 the square of 161, and so on. It gets obvious if we write b's elements in terms of squares:

a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11] 
b = [11*11, 121*121, 144*144, 19*19, 161*161, 19*19, 144*144, 19*19]
Invalid arrays
If we change the first number to something else, comp may not return true anymore:

a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]  
b = [132, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
comp(a,b) returns false because in b 132 is not the square of any number of a.

a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]  
b = [121, 14641, 20736, 36100, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
comp(a,b) returns false because in b 36100 is not the square of any number of a.

Remarks
a or b might be [] (all languages except R, Shell).
a or b might be nil or null or None or nothing (except in Haskell, Elixir, C++, Rust, R, Shell, PureScript).
If a or b are nil (or null or None), the problem doesn't make sense so return false.


problem:- 
given two arrays, the second array should contain all the square results of array1 elements.

rules: - if a or b is empty array or nil return false

algorithm:
- iterate through the first array and get the square of each element
- save the results in a new array
- check if the new array and second array (b) has the same elements
- if yes 
    return true
  else 
    false

def comp(arr1, arr2)
  return false if arr1 == nil || arr2 == nil

  arr1.each do |num|
    squared << num*num
  end
  squared.sort == arr2.sort
end

p comp([121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11], [121, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]) == true
p comp([121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11] , [132, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]) == false
p comp(nil, [1, 2, 3]) == false
p comp([1, 2], []) == false
p comp([1, 2], [1, 4, 4]) == false
